# Medical Record System - GAZA

A modern, professional mobile application for healthcare teams to efficiently manage patient health records‚Äî**offline and online**. Built with React Native, it empowers clinics, hospitals, and field teams to deliver better care, even in low-connectivity environments.

## üìù Feature Details

### 1. Offline-First Mobile App

**What it is:**  
A mobile application (built with React Native) that works **entirely offline**. All patient records are stored locally on the device using SQLite, so healthcare workers can continue their work even if there‚Äôs no internet or power.

**How it works:**
- **Local Database:** Patient data is saved in a local SQLite database on the device.
- **No Connectivity Needed:** Doctors and nurses can add, edit, and view patient records without any network connection.
- **Resilient UI:** The app‚Äôs interface is designed to be fast, simple, and usable even in stressful, low-light, or emergency conditions.
- **Automatic Sync:** When the device later connects to the internet, all new or updated records are automatically queued for cloud sync (see Feature 3).

**Why it matters for Gaza:**  
Power and internet outages are common. This feature ensures that medical teams can always access and update records, no matter the situation.

### 2. Bluetooth Sharing

**What it is:**  
A peer-to-peer data sharing system using Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE). When traditional networks are down, devices can exchange patient records directly with each other.

**How it works:**
- **BLE Sync:** Devices scan for each other and connect using Bluetooth.
- **Record Exchange:** Patient records are securely transferred between devices, even in the absence of WiFi or cellular networks.
- **Conflict Resolution:** The app uses timestamps to resolve which record is the latest if the same patient exists on both devices.
- **Inspired by Gaza‚Äôs Resilience:** This system is modeled after the creative, underground communication methods used in Gaza, ensuring information can still flow when infrastructure is damaged.

**Why it matters for Gaza:**  
When infrastructure is destroyed, this feature allows field teams to keep their data in sync and coordinate care, even in the most challenging conditions.

### 3. Cloud Sync (Supabase)

**What it is:**  
Automatic, secure synchronization of patient records to a cloud database (Supabase) whenever internet access is available.

**How it works:**
- **Background Sync:** The app detects when the device is online and automatically uploads new or updated records to the cloud.
- **Encryption & Security:** All data is encrypted during transfer. Security keys are kept hidden and never exposed in the app.
- **Offline Queue:** If the internet is lost during sync, the app queues the data and retries when connectivity returns.
- **Supabase Backend:** Supabase provides a scalable, secure PostgreSQL database and API for storing and managing patient data.

**Why it matters for Gaza:**  
Even brief moments of connectivity (e.g., via satellite or restored networks) are enough to sync critical data, ensuring that records are safely backed up and accessible to authorized teams.

### 4. NGO Dashboard

**What it is:**  
A web-based dashboard for NGOs and medical coordinators to view real-time patient data, sync status, and on-ground needs.

**How it works:**
- **Data Fetching:** The dashboard connects to the Supabase cloud backend to fetch the latest synced patient records.
- **Analytics & Stats:** Provides visualizations of patient counts, medical conditions, sync status, and geographic distribution.
- **Real-Time Monitoring:** Enables NGOs to track needs, allocate resources, and respond quickly to changing situations in Gaza.
- **Secure Access:** Only authorized users can view sensitive data, maintaining patient privacy.

**Why it matters for Gaza:**  
NGOs and medical teams get a live, accurate picture of health needs and resource gaps, helping them coordinate aid and medical response more effectively.
